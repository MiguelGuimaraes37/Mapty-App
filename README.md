# Mapty-App

<p>
  This project was realized during 
  <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/learn/lecture/22648733#overview" target="_blank">
    Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course
  </a>. Both CSS and HTML were provided by the course.
</p>

<p>
  The goal of this project was to help runners and cyclists track their workouts and 
  identify the places where they train the most.
</p>

<h2>Features Implemented</h2>

<ul>
  <li>DOM Manipulation</li>
  <li>ES6 Classes (App, Workout, Running, Cycling)</li>
  <li><a href="https://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">Leaflet JS API</a></li>
  <li>Local Storage Browser API</li>
</ul>

<h2>OBS:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    This app is designed for use by a single person. It will not work properly if multiple users try to use it because the ID for each workout 
    is generated from the last digits of the current date. If two users create a workout at the same time, it will result in duplicate IDs.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sometimes location services don't work on some browsers. I tested it on Brave and Google Chrome. It works on Google Chrome but not on Brave.
  </li>
</ul>
